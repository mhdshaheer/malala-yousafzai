          <p>
            Malala Yousafzai is a Pakistani activist for female education and
            the youngest Nobel Prize laureate. She is known for human rights
            advocacy, especially the education of women and children in her
            native Swat Valley in northwest Pakistan, where the local Taliban
            had at times banned girls from attending school.
          </p>
          <p>
            Born on July 12, 1997, in Mingora, Pakistan, Malala gained global
            attention after she was shot in the head by a Taliban gunman in 2012
            as she was returning home from school on a bus. She survived the
            attack and has continued her advocacy for education rights.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her courage and resilience in the face of extremism has inspired
            millions around the world. Today, through her Malala Fund, she
            continues to champion every girl's right to 12 years of free, safe,
            quality education.
